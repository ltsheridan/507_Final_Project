This code takes music from Pandora playlists in csv files and uploads them to new Spotify playlists. Two database tables will be created: one for Songs and one for Artists. The purpose of this project is to create better playlists in Spotify using Pandora radio station playlists (which, in my personal opinion have better music variety).
